# Seminar_ThreaTrace
Dockerfile for this Repository: https://github.com/threaTrace-detector/threaTrace

Before starting the Dockerfile, the Threatrace repository must be downloaded and placed next to the Dockerfile in the appropriate folder. The same must be done with the two required Cadets files.

TODO: Adjust 2-3 files in the Docker container so that the scripts for ThreaTrace work. Adjustment of the ThreaTrace files, because only Cadets and not the other hosts are considered here.
